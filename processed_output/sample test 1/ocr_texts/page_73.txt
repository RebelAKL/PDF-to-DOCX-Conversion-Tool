PSC14 - Monitoring and measuring devices validity of previous measurements in case of non- confirming measurement
devices (GM)
The organization assesses (and records) the validity of previous measurements when equipment is found not to conform
to specified requirements, and takes appropriate action on the equipment and any product affected.
The control of the monitoring and measuring devices is adequate to ensure valid results.
Every device which is processed in “Service Center Moislinger Allee” will be listed in SAP system with incoming date. In
SAP the device will be linked to a dedicated work place with ID. Every workspace has a list of measurement equipment
used unique at this place.
In production all used test equipment will be documented in every test protocol in SAP. It will be possible to trace back
every used device with related time-period and related concrete tests and test results. The status of measurement-device
at time of usage can be traced back in MIMS.
Monitoring and measuring devices are protected from damage or deterioration e.g. via limited access to the “Service
Center building Moisslinger Allee” and producstion and the floor where the devices are in usage. Every employee is
teached in handling of the measurement equipment.
No such event occurred so far.
Samples for audited Mesurement equipment with rekated status which have bee checked at workplaces and in MIMS
find under PSC 13.
PSC15 - Validation of software used in production (GM)
In production are parts of SAP in usage. Whole SAP tool with all used modules are validated from SW validation officers
(see also docu Pavlov).
Main used SAP Modul in productionis: PLESS validation protocol have been audited
Furthermore some teststations with SW are in use. Here the whole test sttion will be validated.

PSC 17 - Production record; evidence of compliance of released devices
/I!Service Center - Moislinger Alee/// (HD)
The cleaning of the devices in that are received in the workshop is done by Drager Interservice GmbH. the employees
of the Service Center (sales) receive the devices and assigns them an identifier based on the Serial and Material number
as well as the customer documents that are sent together with the device.
The Service order will be set in SAP, the description of the service, for the Interservice employees and the service
technicians to be able to start the failure diagnosis.
The traceability of the whole process is ensured via SAP system. The service devices are registered and each service
step is documented in SAP based on the service need e.g. code 1150 received in der service center, 1690 service start
in repair center, 1700 end of service, ready to send 4000 etc. The device status in repair center is traceable at any
time also service and spare parts provided are visible to the client via SAP documentation.
The Service Connect tool (www.serviceconnect. dreager.com) will be used for the compilation of the whole service
strategies of the devices, including diagrams and parts list. Maintenance documents which are used for factory services
can be found on the Share Point. The service process is documented and released via SAP.
Brazil and US requirements are full filled, the example above.
