:System Designer and Leader of Verification approve Verification Review, Change Review will be approved by Project
Leader, Quality asssurance and Regulatory Affairs.

USA:

Verify that procedures ensure that participants include representatives of all functions concernedwith the design stage
being reviewed and an individual(s) who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage being reviewed, as well
as any specialists needed [21 CFR 820.30(e)].

The competences and roles reviewers are defined in DWAG IN4230 and DWAG IN4200.

Two samples of Design review have been audited (Verification and Design Change review).

DD15 - Impact review of design and development changes on previously made and distributed devices (GM)
Assessment of Design Changes is defined in DWAG IN4230

Design changes are reviewed for effects on products already delivered. This will be doumented and approved in PKG-
2021-003936, Pretailoring investigation. This document ave been audited for ATLAN 2.0.

Impact review of design and development changes on previously made and distributed devices.

See PTI PKG-2021-001689 Section assessments

DD16 - Design transfer (GM

The design change ATLAN 2.0 was correctly transferred into production.

Design change transfer is defiend in DEMF GM2110 and includes checks for availability of all needed material. The
check will be documented in OA.

Brazil:

Confirm that the manufacture ensures that the design is not released for production until its approval by the persons
assigned by the manufacturer and that the persons assigned review all records required to the design history file in order
to ensure it is complete and the final design is compatible with the approved plans, prior to its release. Confirm that this
release, including date and manual or electronic signature of the responsible is documented [RDC ANVISA 16/2013:
4.1.9, 4.1.11].

Approval of OA (change transfer) will be performed by Quality assurance.

The OA includes the check of all needed deliverables . The OA ATLAN 2.0 have been audited. Triggered by the Change
package and specifically for SW changes amog others e.g. the IFU have been adjustsed.

Process Description:

[ISO 13485:2016: 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 7.1, 7.3]

Devices that are, by regulation, subject to design and development procedures are identified. Main process is DCS
IN4200 that regulates the development of new devices. All design changes are following SOP Design Change Process.
Gate 1 and 2 of main process are research phases, e.g. marked investigation, which is optional. Technical
documentation in terms of Medical Device History is conducted, at each gate appropriate reports are provided. The
fulfillment of the GSPRs are planned and considered.

For the development of Humidstar 2+LL the design and development phase started in gate 3.0. Technology and market
are already known.

Start with

Gate 3.0 Preparation: Design and development will be specified; the product requirements finalized,

Gate 4.0 Definition: e.g. technical system requirements, Usability, plan validation; finalized with System requirement
review (SRR)

Gate 4.1 Design: Detail Q Targets based on SA (system architecture) freeze of requirements.

Gate 5.0 Realization: system integration review, implementation of design; VRR Verification readiness Review, Finalize
Design Transfer

Gate 6.0 Validation: System validation review, official end of development

Gate 7.0 CE marking: Ramp-up / Market Launch: monitoring, in a narrow scheme

Gate 7.1 Serial Production: final production site/ one line and one tool for the device Humidstar 2+LL

Gate 8.0 Life Cycle/Change: targets in quality, financial, on market

The process for Humidstar 2+LL had been defined as a new development:

The Humidstar 2+LL had been designed as new product development.

The Humidstar 2+LL is classified as class Ila product under MDR,

The filter and HMES are currently registered in the following MDSAP countries:

- Australia

- Brasilia

- Canada

The regulatory department confirms that the Humidstar 2+LL are not registered in Japan and USA.
The procedure defines criteria, as applicable for

* new product development

* module development

+ Upgrades and product change

+ Introduction of OEM or private label

* Introduction of Trading goods

+ Transfer of development, production or other disciplines

Changes are managed according to Design Change Process

According to DWAG IN 4230 Design Changes, design change request (DCR) can be issued by anyone. Project Manager
with team of QM and R&D the request will be assessed.

Change process flow will be individually decided depending on the request.
