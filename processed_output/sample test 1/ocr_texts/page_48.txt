Selection of the product / project for assessment

SW package Connect Lung Protective Ventilation Analytics - Anesthesia (LPVA) was selected for this
audit in line with an audit sampling plan.

Additional action items for the audit was to confirm that this SW can be considered as non-medical device

Evaluation if the sampled Software is a non-medical device
Marketing presentation Connected — Lung _ protective Ventilation Analytics
Hospital-data-analytics was demonstrated and assessed during the audit:
The software offers following functionality:
- Shows Ventilation Quality indicators to improve the team ventilation performance
- Analysis of parameters, ventilation modes and_ recruitment maneuvers
- Enables a consistent implementation _ of lung protective ventilation practices
- Provides benchmarking of Ventilation performance against pre-defined goals
The function of demo Software was demonstrated.
The data are collected once a day from each connected anesthesia devices, the connection assured via
additional Infrastructure software Drager Gateway, which assures the connectivity of Drager devices and
Darger SW application devices
The data are requested retrospectively from the use case perfume ate pervisu period

Ventilation parameters: which are demonstrated are following:
VT /IBW, ml/kg
PEEP - pressure

The results are indicating with red / amber / green indication for the visuals demonstration of not-
recommended / possible and recommended parameters areas, while the outcome from the date transfer
show the actual statistical evaluation of the past uses of the anesthesia device.

The patient data are not transferred and not process by the software.

The SW cannot control or impact medical device. The data are collected after the Anastasia session (the
Anesthesia medical device shall be in standby after completion of clinical procedure) and therefore does not
deliver information which can be and input to immediate use for the handling of the individual patient.
Therefore , the auditor concluded that the abovementioned Software is not a Standalone Medical device
software and not software with is integrated in Medical device Hardware.

Design and development process

The Software is developed under 1SO9001:2015 requirements, according the Software Design Process.
Draeger has established the process for Design and develpment

The processes are defined and documented as set of procedures : DWAG IN 4200 is established ad
applicable to medical and non-medical devices.

The stage -gate is process is defined with 8 stages, whereas first 3 stage-gates form pre-design concepts
phase.

All design changes are following SOP Design Change Process.

Start with Gate 3.0 Preparation ==> 4.0 Definition ==> 4.1 Design ==> 5.0 Realization ==> 6.0 Validation
==> 7.0 CE/ Ramp-up / Market Launch ==> 7.1 Serial Production ==> Gate 8.0 Life Cycle/Change

At the same time, the designated process DEMF IN6000 is documented design and development of non-
medical software:

The process DEMF IN6000-en-00 Development of non-medical device software has been developed and
laid from May 2023, however was not used during the design and development of LPV software. It also
contains the requirements for the changes. The change to the new process is planned to be completed
by may 20224

In the absence of documented process for non-medical device software, the process IN4200 for MD-
Software was partly applied +, however according to design and development plan — the

DWAG |IN4200 : Develop Product was used only to make the plane, the plans however contained the
statement that DWAG was only used for the panning stage.

8.3.2 Design and development planning

Design and development plan Rev 3.7 was demonstrated.

The roles and resources are defined - the product management teams is demonstrated.
The stages are defined as

Issue — Iteration.
