The team manager determines the required trainings for each employee (role specifics), together with the qualifications
which are communicated to HR and evaluated once a year. Basic requirements are predefined for types of roles and
entities (e.g. leader, or D&D)
The team leaders are responsible to communicate the requirements for new employees. There are general trainings
that all employees should perform (e.g.: data security, work safety, among others). The responsibility of the
performance of the trainings is taken by the corresponding management.
Once the requirements have been identified, there will be training measures set. Depending on characteristics of
needed qualifications trainings will be identified covering required competences.
The trainings performed are documented in training records. Templates are used
(e.g. Teilnehmerliste). Trainings could be online or onsite trainings.
Effectiveness checks of trainings can be defined individually for all trainings and e.g. doumented on “Teilnehemerliste”
or other suplemental documents if needed.
Generrally, the effectiveness checks will be performed during each training. The team leader determines whether
additional effectiveness checks of the trainings should be done, based on the responsibilities of the employee (the
latest Q-check).
A yearly effectiveness check will be performed by team leaders for every enployee and documented on Q-Check
template. Additionnally, an individual apraisal will be performed for each employee which can be denied by employee
