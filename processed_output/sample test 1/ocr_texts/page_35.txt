Subsystem Design and Development
An evaluation of the impact of the changes on already delivered devices is included in the template for PTI. For the
examples taken, it was possible to follow the impact analysis and the corresponding activities to be performed on the
devices on the field. The impact of DCR was reviewed during the audit for biocompatibility test report and usability test
report (Inspection Report No 21 -00620)
D&D 16 - Design transfer (HD)
At the end of design and development the design has been transferred to the production site at Revalstrasse at Drager.
The design change steps are signed/ released in SAP by the click on the checklist status is visible who and when has
releases each step.
Additional country-specific requirements:
(Brazil) The devices are released for production only after correct approval from the corresponding personnel, which
includes quality assurance. The release is documented and signed accordingly.

DD12 - Software design and development (MSz)
Software design and development
Since medical device contains software, verified that the software was subject to the design and development process.
It could be confirmed that the software was included within the risk management process.
DD13-15 - Design and development change Babyleo TN300__(MSz)
Verified that design and development changes were controlled, verified (or where appropriate validated), and approved
prior to implementation.
It also could be confirmed that any new risks associated with the design change have been identified and mitigated to the
extent practical.

Product Steering Board consist of interdisciplinary team and manages the product changes latest after design transfer by
selecting them combining and planning product changes according to the business objectives. Attendees are at east:
Product Manager, Project Manager , Quality Assurance and Regulatory affairs; depending of the nature of the design
change project, the PSB mits be supporte by subject matter experts.
