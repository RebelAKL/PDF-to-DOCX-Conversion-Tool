Subsystem Production and Service Controls - #90464 (RevalstraRe/Ambia)
Hazardous Situation RM-SUS 4178 Contamination of parts in contact to the gas flow during transport, storage,
production, installation and service
Risk Control Measures
RCM RM_SUS_4869 Production: gas leading hoses must be packed clean and free from impurity, protected against
contamination (Hoses Ends must be sealed)
RCM_SUS_4910 Production: Gas hoses shall be visibiliy checekd by an incoming inspection
RCM_SUS_5417 Production FMEA shall evaluate the risk of soiling hoses or tubes during production.
RCM_SUS_5515 Warnig in Service Instructions “Gas and electrical installations may only be carried out by trained
service personell; Do not allow any contamination (especially oil, grease, or flammable liquids) into the lines or in the
terminal unit.”

PSC-2 Selection of production and service process(es)
Complete Production has been audited including several processes that directly impact the ability of the device to meet
its essential design outputs.
PSC-5 Infrastructure
Verified that the organization has determined and documented the infrastructure requirements to achieve product
conformity, including buildings, workspace, process equipment, and supporting services.
Confirmed that buildings, workspaces, and supporting services allow product to meet requirements.
Verified that there are documented and implemented requirements for maintenance of process equipment where
important for product quality, and that records of maintenance are maintained.
Brazil (ANVISA):
Verify that manufacturing facilities are configured in order to provide adequate means for people flow.
PSC-6 Work environment
Verified that documented requirements have been established, implemented and maintained for:
- health, cleanliness, and clothing of personnel that could have an adverse effect on
- product quality
- monitoring and controlling work environment conditions that can have an adverse effect on product quality
- training or supervision of personnel who are required to work under special environmental conditions
- controlling contaminated or potentially contaminated product (including returned products) in order to prevent
contamination of other product, the work environment, or personnel
PTS Chapter 1.1.1 Umweltanforderungen:
PTS_509: 5°-35°
5%-95%
950 - 1060hPa
These conditions are confirmed during Gas Test
Brazil (ANVISA)
No specific Biosafety Standards applicable
PSC-7 Identification of processes subject to validation
Determined if the selected process and sub-process have been reviewed, including any outsourced processes, to
determine if validation of these processes is required.
Process Validation Report Production Ambia Aras 11044209 Rev. 0.0
Attachment 01 to Process Validation Report Production Ambia 1200113578 POS 20 EM 2021-08-19
Key Targets of Process Validation have been reached; however, unacceptable PFR (production Failure Rate) has been
adressed during Gate 7.0 meeting to be adressed in Product Steering Board. It is also monitored on a daily basis by the
Project Engineer and reported weekly into PSB and biweekly into PQB; LCE (Life Cycle Engineering is responsible for
further improvement.
Brazil (ANVISA):
Verified that analytical methods, supporting auxiliary systems for production and environmental control that can
adversely affect product quality or the quality system are validated, periodically reviewed and, when necessary,
revalidated according to documented procedures.
United States (FDA):
Not applicable
PSC-10 Monitoring and measurement of product conformity
Verified that the system for monitoring and measuring of product characteristics is capable of demonstrating the
conformity of products to specified requirements.
It could be confirmed that product risk is considered in the type and extent of product monitoring activities.
PSC-11 Control, operation, and monitoring of the production and service process; risk controls
Verifed that the processes used in production and service are appropriately controlled, monitored, operated within
specified limits and documented in the product realization records.
In addition, verifed that risk control measures identified by the manufacturer for production processes are implemented,
monitored and evaluated.
