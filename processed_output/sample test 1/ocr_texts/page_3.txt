The audit plan contains detailed information about the audit. The specific audit scope as documented in the audit
plan defines locations / organizational units, activities, and processes with reference to standard clauses covered
during this audit as well as to related audit duration (see section 2.2).

The objective of this audit is to verify the conformity and effectiveness of the manufacturer’s quality management
system (or parts of it) with applicable requirements (statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements, etc.) as
