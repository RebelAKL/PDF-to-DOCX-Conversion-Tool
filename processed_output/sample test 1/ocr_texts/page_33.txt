The changes were accumulated as following:

DCR-2019-002082 labeling amassing - change of the labels size - SW only
DCR-2021-002127 ISM-IEC TR60601-4-5

DCR-20201 003730 - approval of the Zeus IE

The package summary is in process of implementation and is not accomplished as a packages, therefore this cannot be
used for the full assessment.

The example of the changes was assessed during the audit:

The regulatory affairs department is also including in the pre-tailoring investigation considering the requirements for each
country where the device is marketed and the notifications to be done previous to the approval of the change.

D&D #14 - Design review (GP)

The design reviews are established and the content for each review is defined accordingly. For medical devices the
reviews are performed according to DWAG IN4200-en-01.00 Design.

The Design Sub Process contains five major Design Reviews on system level:

. System Requirements Review

System Architecture Review

System Integration Review (for each integration loop).

Verification Readiness Review

System Validation Review

Besides these major Design Reviews on system level, there are additional Design Reviews that are part of other process
steps that are required as completion criteria. Design Reviews have to be

conducted according to IN4204. Design Review reports are records and have to be filed into the DHF.

Example — Example ///SW Smart Pilot View -design change to Rev 3.03///

As this design project was controlled as design change , standard design review requirements were not applicable. The
project was released as 11134555 Design change review report

US

Procedures ensure that participants include representatives of all functions concerned with the design stage being
reviewed and an individual(s) who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage being reviewed.

D&D #15 - Impact review of design and development changes on previously made and distributed devices (GP)

An evaluation of the impact of the changes on already delivered devices is included in the template for Pre-Tailori8ng
Investigation PTI. For the examples taken, it was possible to follow the impact analysis and the corresponding activities
to be performed on the devices on the field.

Example ///SW Smart Pilot View -design change to Rev 3.03///
Drager has demonstrated PTI PKG-2021-002776 from 23.05.2022, which encompasses charges for Smart Pilot View
such as DCR-2022-002200 and DCR-2022-002214

D&D #16 - Design transfer (GP)

For Software products, the process for Design Transfer of medical software is performed according to DWAG IN4206
Software Approval and Design Transfer and is documented in DCS IN4206-110

The release and transfer includes the following steps:

- Check software development plan and deliverables

- Check software verification

- Check list of non-conformities

- Check Software Build

- Assure reliable delivery -Assure reliable delivery of the released software without corruption or unauthorized change,
and where media are used that contain the released software, address their replication, media labeling, packaging,
protection, storage, and delivery. Documented as Plan for malware-free shipping

- Create and upload Software Archive according to IN4206 ARAS Manual

Logistically relevant software needs to be transferred from development to production and service. The software
executables become part of the DMR, stored in PLM SYSTEM, on DVDs or on a server with controlled access and
configuration control. The following documentation structure is fully supported by PLM SYSTEM but is also applicable to
other storage concepts.

Example ///SW Smart Pilot View -design change to Rev 3.03///

Elements of approval and design transfer records as required by DCS IN4206 were requested and assessed during the
audit:
