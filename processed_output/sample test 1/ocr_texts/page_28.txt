CRT Action Item Drager FSCA ICM PR126573, TPS ID VM63012:
“The investigation confirmed that when ICM is used in combination with a syringe pump connection, under certain
under certain conditions, ICM may show entries in the daily curve that were not deliberately created by the user. These
entries cannot be edited or deleted by the user. If these additional entries
unnoticed, this can lead to inaccurate documentation of prescriptions or previous treatment in the program.
program and thus potentially lead to incorrect treatment decisions.” Action Item: “Since the Cause of the behaviour has
been identified, please review the rationale for not updating the affected systems, considering the principle of
integrated safety”.
During audit, manufacturer provided updated information on that case and behavior. This behavior has been changed
in the next regular release of the Software (V14) and in Bugfix Version (V 13.02, released 07/2023). Therefore the
requested rationale is not needed anymore.
The Bugfix Version will be rolled out with a new Field action (see “Decision and Order”)
Background Information (as communicated to BFARM 2023-08-08):
ICM is used by customers in 5 different Software Versions (V9-V13).
Bug fixing was available with V13.02 (available since 07/2023) and V14.
Installation of V12 + V13 are technically updateable to 13.02; however, this involves a high effort withing hospitals,
since the IT infrastructure is involved; therefore, Drager forecasts this update to take around 12 months time.
The problem described within FSCA can only happen in installations that use the option “Syringe Pumps Connection’;
this connection is only be used by very few customers. Drager will approach customers with these versions in order to
either update to V13.02 or to deactivate the option causing the issue.
