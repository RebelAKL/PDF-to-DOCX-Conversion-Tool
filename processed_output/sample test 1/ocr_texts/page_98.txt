Infection Prevention and Control

Breaking the chain of infection and complying with your hospital's hygiene protocols is critical in
today's clinical

environment. For this reason, during the development phase of Atlan anesthesia machines, we
designed them

with infection prevention regulations in mind to support hygiene measures in the OR.

— Tool-free and quick disassembly of breathing system with few parts to be compliant with
infection

prevention regulations

— Smooth and rounded surfaces ease cleaning/wipe disinfection

— Cable ducts and channels reduce number of potential contamination sources

— Compatible with original Drager single-use consumables support hygiene standards

— Generated message* reminds personnel about the replacement of the RFID technology-based
consumables (Infinity ID breathing circuit, Infinity ID WaterLock 2 water trap, Infinity ID flow
sensors,

Infinity ID CLIC absorber) when their maximum period of use are exceeded

— Compliant with ISO 17664

Provision of Information for Use on Reprocessing
It was verified that reprocessing instructions include in validated reprocessing method were
included in the Labeling / Instruction for Use

For Rev 1.0 Instruction for Use Ver SEW-1.0 —formation for reprocessing was included in the IFU
directly

For Rev 2.0 Instruction for USE Anesthesia workstation Software 2.0n — info on reprocess was
removed from main IFU and included in the dedicated Information on reprocessing is now
included in standalone reprocessing Instruction for Use (9510631_1_en)

Identification of criticality of reprocessing
According to Reprocessing Instruction, following classification defined:

Classification Explanation

Non-critical Components that come only into contact with skin that is
intact

Semi-critical Components that carry breathing gas or come into contact
with mucous membranes or pathologically altered skin

Critical Components that penetrate skin or mucous membranes or

come into contact with blood

Identification of parts subject for reprocessing

The following classification is a recommendation from Drager.
Non-critical

- Device surfaces

Semi-critical

- Breathing system

- Housing (lower part and upper part)

- Inspiratory port

-  Expiratory port

-—  APLvalve

- _ Inspiratory valve (yellow)

-  Expiratory valve (blue)

-  Fresh-gas decoupling valve (black)

— Absorber container and absorber insert

- Sensor cap of the O2 sensor1)

- Piston diaphragm

- Breathing bag arm (option)
