released for distribution; labeling; identification of the serial number or batch of production; and final release of the
product [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 3.2.1].
Verify that labeling has not been released for storage or use until a designated individual has examined the labeling for
accuracy. The approval, including the date, name, and physical or electronic signature of the person responsible, must
be documented in the device history record [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.2.2.3].

specifications and are documented.
It have been confirmed based on samples (e.g. leakage testing, pressure tests, electrical safety testing and
verifications of individual configurations and accompanying labels and documents) that the extent of
acceptance activities is commensurate with the risk posed by the device.
///Revalstr. — “Line 2—ATLAN  "///
2 samples from ATLAN series have been audited:
Herstellprotokoll A 350 SN ASSK-0057, Auftragsnummer 62730423
USA:
Verify that the manufacturer establishes and maintains procedures to ensure that sampling methods are adequate for
their intended use and ensure that when changes occur, the sampling plans are reviewed [21
CFR 820.250(b)].
Brazil:
Verify that sampling plans are defined and based on valid statistical rationale. Each manufacturer must establish and
maintain procedures to ensure that sampling methods are suitable for their intended use and
are reviewed regularly. A review of sampling plans should consider the occurrence of nonconforming product, quality
audit reports, complaints and other indicators [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 9.2].
Acceptance process based on 100% verification, therefore sampling is NA
