D&D #17 - Top management commitment to design and development process (GP)
Based on the assessment of Smart Pilot View Update design project, Top management has demonstrated the
commitment or design and development by providing the resources, systems and process.

D&D 13 - Design and development change (HD)

The process is established and documented in DWAG IN 42 30 design change.

A change request is prepared and evaluated by quality assurance, project manager and the product manager, these
changes could be improvement of changes triggered by post-production feedback. In the case the change influences
materials, and these materials are used for other products, the change needs to be assessed by other PSB. Product
Manager and/or other functions decide on the DCR (accept or decline).

After the design change has been accepted, the design change project will be created. This includes the design change
plan, change project, pre-tailoring investigation (central document about which components are affected, recommended
solution and which design reviews should be met), Object List (components which are going to be change), List of
deliverables (which documents should be change).

Additional country-specific requirements:

(Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, US)

The regulatory affairs department is also including in the pre-tailoring investigation considering the requirements for each
country where the device is marketed and the notifications to be done previous to the approval of the change.

The design package needs to be approved, from quality and project management, and then it will be implemented
(documented in DHR, DHF, work items).

A design review will be performed when all the changes are ready for release. This includes an evaluation of the status
of the changes and the documentation that was generated (quality and regulatory affairs). It will be proved at the end if
regulatory changes have been done, and if the country organizations should be informed.

At the end the materials/components will be released and finalized (Quality Assurance).

Example Flow sensor:

The product was previously purchased and delivered as a finished medical device and is now manufactured on
Revalstrafe. It have been a strategic decision. Additionally, the color of the hose was change and the shape of hose
slightly modified.

DCR 2020-001379 dd. 31 05.2020/PKG 2020 000943

Flow sensor classification:

It is not active device as pressure measurement device per se is in the connected device itself (Oxylog). The flow sensor
has no energy source (does not need it) and is non active as per MDR definition. The pressure is transfer to the end
device (Oxylog) and is measured based on volume converting.

The classification process and assignment of the EMND codes presented during the audit seems plausible and
appropriate.

D&D 14 - Design review (HD

The design reviews are established and the content for each review is defined accordingly. For medical devices the
reviews are performed according to DWAG IN4200-en-01.00 Design.

The Design Sub Process contains five major Design Reviews on system level:

. System Requirements Review

System Architecture Review

System Integration Review (for each integration loop).

Verification Readiness Review

System Validation Review

The issuing authorities for release including Tester, products owner, Quality and regulatory.

USA: There are a process in place (DWAG IN4200-en-01.00 Design). The competences and roles reviewers are defined
in DWAG IN4230 and DWAG IN4200. Design review have been audited (Verification and Design Change review).
