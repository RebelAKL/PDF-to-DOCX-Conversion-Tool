ISO 13485:2016: 4.2.1, 6.3, 7.5.1;
Process Description:
Drager realizes that product quality can be influenced by the production work environment. Drager directs, regulates,
coordinates, and monitors activities and variables that affect the conditions such that the quality of the work environment
is known. Manufacturing equipment is designed, constructed, installed, and located to facilitate proper operation,
maintenance, adjustment, and cleaning.
The organization has determined and documented the infrastructure requirements to achieve product conformity,
including buildings, workspace, process equipment, and supporting services.
Buildings, workspaces, and supporting services allow product to meet requirements.
There are documented and implemented requirements for maintenance of process equipment where important for
product quality, and that records of maintenance are maintained.
In the Cleanroom the monitoring of temperature and humidity is ensured by continuously measuring by installed sensors.
For the access of the cleanroom, material and personal locks are separated. Clear instruction for entrance are available.
