NPI — New Product Introduction

United States (FDA):

Confirmed that the organization has determined the applicability of unique device identifier requirements per 21 CFR 801
and 21 CFR 830, has obtained the unique device identifiers from an FDA-accredited UDI-issuing agency, and the
required data elements have been entered in the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) [21 CFR 801,
830].

PSC#2 Selection of production and service process(es)

Reviewed production processes considering the following criteria and selected several production processes to audit.
Priority criteria for selection:

+ Use of production processes that directly impact the ability of the device to meet its essential design outputs

+ New production processes or new product to be introduced in future (Albus Ventilation System (0-Series planned for
2027).

PSC#5 Infrastructure

Verified that the organization has determined and documented the infrastructure requirements to achieve product
conformity, including buildings, workspace, process equipment, and supporting services.

Confirmed that buildings, workspaces, and supporting services allow product to meet requirements.

Verified that there are documented and implemented requirements for maintenance of process equipment where
important for product quality, and that records of maintenance are maintained.

Brazil (ANVISA):
Verified that manufacturing facilities are configured in order to provide adequate means for people flow. [RDC ANVISA
16/2013: 5.1.2].

PSC#6 Work environment

Verified that documented requirements have been established, implemented and maintained for:

- health, cleanliness, and clothing of personnel that could have an adverse effect on

- product quality

- monitoring and controlling work environment conditions that can have an adverse effect on product quality

- training or supervision of personnel who are required to work under special environmental conditions

- controlling contaminated or potentially contaminated product (including returned products) in order to prevent
contamination of other product, the work environment, or personnel.

Brazil (ANVISA)
No specific Biosaftey Standards applicable

PSC#7 Identification of processes subject to validation

Determined if the selected process(es) and sub-process(es) have been reviewed, including any outsourced processes,
to determine if validation of these processes is required. At the stage being, no process validation is required (100%
individual end control of finished medical devices.

Brazil (ANVISA):
nla

United States (FDA):
Process validation n/a

PSC #10 Monitoring and measurement of product conformity

Verified that the system for monitoring and measuring of product characteristics is capable of demonstrating the
conformity of products to specified requirements.

It could be confirmed that product risk is considered in the type and extent of product monitoring activities.

PSC#11 Control, operation, and monitoring of the production and service process; risk controls
Verifed that the processes used in production and service are appropriately controlled, monitored, operated within
specified limits and documented in the product realization records.

In addition, verifed that risk control measures identified by the manufacturer for production processes are implemented,
monitored and evaluated.

At time of audit, Integration System iteration 3 is ongoing with 130 devices to be produced; this is made under as realistic
production conditions as possible, however, not yet with finally approved components, parts, work instructions and
measuring equipment. Produced devices are not yet labelled with a CE mark, however, rest of label is already as realistic
as in this development stage possible. All devices manufacture in this stage will stay internally; they are either provided
to R+D for further development input, or to Test center for testing; none of these devices is planned or qualified to be
placed on the market, all integration systems will be scrapped later.

Traceability

SAP status ensures that Integration Systems are logistically not able to be placed on the market. This is traced
electronically by Revision Index, Serialnumber, material number

Material number and revision index must be released in SAP with status "Serial" to be shippable; Serial number also
contains date information that would prevent future erroneous release/marketing.
