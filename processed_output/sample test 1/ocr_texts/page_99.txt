The validation of the device service cleaning was not assessed in thei audit as law risk
and not directly relevant to safety and performance of the device. The recommended
chemical for surface cleaning were widely available and listed by national Guidance
documents.

The machine decontamination in washer-disinfector observed during the audit is widely
acceptable standard washer-disinfector cycle with AO>3000 (high level disinfection)

Validation / verification of the reprocessing procedure

Two validation documents were demonstrated during the audit. Valuation was performed in Miele
Washer-disinfector, using the decontamination cycle and process chemicals as recommended in
the Reprocessing Instruction.

Two documents were demonstrated during the audit:
1) Cleaning Efficacy for the representative parts from the breathing circuit —

Test soil used — BCA Protein Assay KIT from Thermo Scientific
