Nevertheless, the methodology, criteria for validation and the tests performed can be regarded as
state of the art commensurate to the area and criticality of application taking into account:
1) Standard widely used methodology for machine reprocessing of reusable medical
devices — thermo-disinfection with standard cycle and AO=3000
2) Widely used chemicals for cleaning and neutralization, also recommended by
manufacturer of washer-disinfector.
3) The Validation used methods generally accepted in |S015883-1
4) The fact the reprocessed parts are not invasive and in normal
and tissues of the patients.
The cleaning instruction was found in lined with verified reprocessing methods
