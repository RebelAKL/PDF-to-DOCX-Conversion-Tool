Control of monitoring and measuring equipment (7.6)

PSC13 monitoring and measuring devices needed _ (GM) 7.6
The organization has determined the monitoring and measuring devices needed to provide evidence of
conformity to specified requirements. Devices are listed in MIMS System.
The monitoring and measuring equipment used in production and service control has been identified, adjusted,
calibrated and maintained, and is capable of producing valid results. For verification several samples in Service
enter and ATLAN production have been audited.
Calibration of measurement equipment is performed in specific intervals (usually once a year or after 18
months)
Calibration is currently done by “Kalibrierlabor Revalstr.” which counts as provider. In some cases devices
can be caibrated with other external partners (e.g. Testo)
All measuring devices are listed and controlled in MIMS with ID-number, last calibration date, next calibration
date, calibration evidence.
Responsible persons in Service Center Moislinger Allee and production get once a month an email with status
of devices for notification of devices that must be calibrated.
Futhermore, each employee of service center is responsible to check calibration status of used devices which
is labeled on each device.
Calibration certificates are stored and maintained in MIMS
Devices are marked with an ID number and the date of the next calibration.

PSC14 monitoring and measuring devices validity of previous measurements in case of _non- confirming measurement
devices (GM) 7.6

MDR 2017/745 / IVDR 2017/746
e Test equipment used shall be possible to trace back adequately the calibration of that test equipment. (MDR /IVDR
Annex IX_2.2 (e) , MDR Annex XI 6.2)

The organization assesses (and records) the validity of previous measurements when equipment is found not
to conform to specified requirements, and takes appropriate action on the equipment and any product affected.
The control of the monitoring and measuring devices is adequate to ensure valid results.

Every device which is processed in “Service Center Moislinger Allee” will be listed in SAP system with
incoming date. In SAP the device will be linked to a dedicated work place with ID. Every workspace has a list of
measurement equipment used unique at this place.

In production all used test equipment will be documented in every test protocol in SAP. It will be possible to
trace back every used device with related time-period and related concrete tests and test results. The status of
measurement-device at time of usage can be traced back in MIMS.

Monitoring and measuring devices are protected from damage or deterioration e.g. via limited access to the
“Service Center building Moisslinger Allee” and producstion and the floor where the devices are in usage.
Every employee is teached in handling of the measurement equipment.

No such event occurred so far.

Samples for audited Mesurement equipment with rekated status which have bee checked at workplaces and in
MIMS find under PSC 13.

Customer Property is identified as such with label when received. The reception of devices from customer is
managed using the service and maintenance procedure.

Every devices in Service center are labeled as such with “Meldungs Nummer” /order no in SAP and colored
sticker. The red sticker indicates that cleaning procedure have been finished.

Non-confrming product (8.3)
PSC22 identification, control, and disposition of nonconforming products is adequate (LA) 8.3
///Revalstr. — “Line 2—ATLAN  "///
There are two areas for storage of non-conforming products. All Non- conforming product is labeled with
“Sperraufkleber”, edged with red color. The “Sperraufkleber” contains serial no, product code, order no and
reason for blocking.
In case of Non-conforming product components an additional specific cupboard is used.
