PSC#12 Competence of personnel
Verified that personnel are competent to implement and maintain the processes in accordance with the requirements
identified by the organization.

PSC#13 Control of monitoring and measuring device

Confirmed that the organization has determined the monitoring and measuring devices needed to provide evidence of
conformity to specified requirements. Verified that the monitoring and measuring equipment used in production and
service control has been identified, adjusted, calibrated and maintained, and capable of producing valid results.
Verified that the control of the monitoring and measuring devices is adequate to ensure valid results. Confirmed that
monitoring and measuring devices are protected from damage or deterioration.

PSC#14 Impact analysis of monitoring and measuring device found out of specifications

Confirmed that the organization assesses (and records) the validity of previous measurements when equipment is found
not to conform to specified requirements, and takes appropriate action on the equipment and any product affected.

n/a for this process, since devices will not be released for marketing/clinical use

PSC#15 Validation of software used for the control of the production and service process

Checked if the selected process are software controlled, or if software is used in production equipment or the quality
management system. If so Verified that the software is validated for its intended use.

Software validation may be part of equipment qualification.

Process defines use of Checklist to define if Software is Quality relevant.

A QPS Critically assessment is done — QMS software is classified into categories |, Il, or Ill. Based on that, a test
specification is created. Criteria for classification are Software Category (non-configured, Configured, customized),
Impact of malfunction and Propability of detection.

At time of audit, 253 Quality relevant Software Tools are listed in the QPS list, of which 67 are categorized to be Class 3.

Screening of Service records for potential events/Complaints has been validated (Tool existing since 2005).

PSC#16 Device master file

Determined that the manufacturer has established and maintained a file for each type of device that includes or refers to
the location of device specifications, production process specifications, quality assurance procedures, traceability
requirements, and packaging, labeling specifications, and when applicable requirements for installation and servicing.

Confirmed that the manufacturer determined the extent of traceability based on the risk posed by the device in the event
the device does not meet specified requirements

Produktionsspezifikation PTS 11201373 Draft Version (will be approved to gate 6 or production readiness review).
Contains relevant product and variant specific test requirements.

Australia (TGA):
n/a — not implantable

Brazil (ANVISA):
Dragerwerk has established and maintains procedures to ensure integrity and to prevent accidental mixing of labels,
instructions, and packaging materials. Labels are designed, printed and, where applicable, applied so that they remain
legible and attached to the product during processing, storage, handling and use.

Canada (HC):
Not yet applicable at thias stage of Design and Development, since products are not to be released to the market yet.

United States (FDA):
Not yet applicable at thias stage of Design and Development, since products are not to be reldeased to the market yet.

PSC#17 Production record; evidence of compliance of released devices

Determined that the manufacturer has established and maintained a record of the amount manufactured and approved
for distribution for each batch of medical devices, the record is verified and approved, the device is manufactured
according to the file referenced in task 16, and the requirements for product release were met and documented.

Brazil (ANVISA):
Verifed that the device history record of the product includes or refers to the following information: date of manufacture;
components used; quantity manufactured; results of inspections and tests; parameters of special processes; quantity
released for distribution [not yet recorded since devices are not to be Ireleased fto be marketed]; labeling; identification of
the serial number or batch of production; and final release of the product L all this is recorded and documented already
in order to simulate realisticconditions.
