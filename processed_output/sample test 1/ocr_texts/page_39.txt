Subsystem Design and Development
List of applicable standard for the HME device are listed within the PTS.
“Production and test specification for medical breathing filters and HME”
US:
A process is in place to identify the applicable requirements.
D&D #5 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 4.2.1, 5.2, 7.2.1, 7.3.3;
Process Description:
Design Inputs are for example user needs, customer functional, performance and safety requirements, intended use and
regulatory requirements. For each project there is an applicable list of standards documented which needs to be applied
within the development phase. Regulatory, functional and safety requirements as well as intend use are subject to SOP
and are also addressed in the design change by tailoring of the development process. Requirements are checked for
conflicts in the system requirements review report. Risk management outputs serve as design input.
For US:
No 510k is applicable for the selected device
D&D #6 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 7.3.3
Process Description:
The Design Inputs are unambiguous and do not conflict with each other. Requirements are checked for conflicts in the
system requirements review report. All requirements are checked and approved within the SAR.
For Humidstar 2+LL project no Management commitment and Kick off meeting was not requested as the product
portfolio AFO was already approved. For the development process of Humidstar 2+LL as part of the portfolio the gates 1
& 2 had been skipped.
The list of deliverables (required records) had to be fulfilled.
Australia:
Relevant Medical Device Standards are considered and in scope of the development process for Humidstar 2+ LL
D&D #7 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 4.2.1,4.2.3, 7.3.4
Process Description:
Design and development outputs (e.g. device specifications) are traceable to the design and development inputs.
Specifications are also traceable to the verifications. Traceability description for the change project reviewed.
For the Medical Device File a documentation matrix is available which shows the locations of the applicable specification,
bill of material, applicable tests.
DEALL PQ3130 Control of Documents and Records, Rev.4, 2023-07-06:
A 02, 2023-09-12: Dokumentationsmatrix: Device master record (DMR):
Parts of DMR predefined for design transfer.
Partial specification, and other specification are listed.
The cross functional team decided supplier ULAX, Motala Sweden, producer of the HME foam.
D&D #8 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 4.2.1, 7.1, 7.3.3, 7.3.4;
Process Description:
General the risk management is applied,.
A complete Risk Management process according to ISO 14971 is implemented and is part of the design and
development. Risk acceptance criteria are defined. Risk management has been adapted for change and is up-to-date.
The risk management includes the identification of risks, its assessment and the definition of measures to counteract
those risks.
Companywide risks are assessed; Severity and Probability are defined, and measurable with results in defined classes
“frequent, occasional, low, impossible”.
US: Identified risks are reduced as far as possible, reduction of risks are dedicated to a new assessment to avoid
implementation of new hazards.
D&D #9 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 7.1, 7.3.6, 7.3.7;
Process Description:
In the design and development verification/validation the effectiveness of the risk control measures are verified.
Verification testing is a central part of the design process and is typically conducted in an independent design verification
department. These activities include testing against international standards.
D&D #10 (MGa’
ISO 13485:2016: 4.2.1, 7.3.7;
Process Description:
The development validation phase shows that the design meets the intended use.
Australia:
environmental conditions are considered and described within the IFU, e.g. temperature, re. humidity and ambient
pressure, see DD-1
