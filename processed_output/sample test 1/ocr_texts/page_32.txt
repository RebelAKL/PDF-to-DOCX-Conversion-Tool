Subsystem Design and Development

From design and development plan, software requirements, software architecture, detailed design, implementation of
software units, the process includes _ the Software classification (medical devices) DWAG-IN42_A05 — specific
requirements for software.

Most of the Software are class C, with some exceptions in class B,

Unit testing is done by code review (by at least 2 people based on the Code Guidelines), Static Code Analysis, and
automated unit tests.

After the unit test have been completed, the Software will be integrated, which is continuously happening. When more
items are affected by the change, there will be additional tests performed to prove correct functionality.

The system tests will be then performed, to prove that the Software Requirements have been implemented and are
fulfilled.

After the Software System test is closed, and additional system tests which are performed together with the Hardware
components. The results of the verification will be documented in a report, for the Software, also for the whole system.
After the release of the Software, a regulatory check will be done to determine if additional activities with regards to
normative requirements should be performed.

Cybersecurity is also included in the Software development. There will be a thread analysis performed. The inputs for
this analysis TR 60601-4, thread analysis template, system architecture, among others. The output for the process is the
thread analysis which flows into the risk analysis process of the device, where the corresponding measures will be set.
Verifications of cybersecurity measures follow the risk management and software development process.

Anomalies are classified as serious, significant, important, noticeable or no effect. CIN-Classification critical important
notable.
Example ///SW Smart Pilot View -design change to Rev 3.03///
The Software designed is perfumed in line with requirement of |S062304. INSPECTION REPORT
IEC 62304 process inspection by the accredited test lab Product Qualification, Dragerwerk AG & Co.KGaA was
demonstrated during the audit.
Software Class according IEC 62304 is determined Class B (According to the risk assessment table, the expected harm
that could result from software failure is limited to “minor”). — observed in 5.1 Product Risk Management Report -
11149328 _03
The process was performed under the guidance of design change process DWAG IN4230 Design Changes, the changes
were followed by verification and validation prior to release, which was sampled and assessed during this audit.
The devices validation is defined in design Process IN4200. The step is performed between the Gate 6.0 and gate 7.0
Following inputs and outputs were regarded for the Validation stage
- Usability evaluation
- Validation plan
- Validation summary report
- Reliability Review
- User requirements DR-00072766 Product requirement’s Smart pilotbase Line 2022-11-24T
Particular examples of product requirements were sampled during the audit and implementation was verified
PR-SPV_309 mart Pilot shall support Wierda PK Model _for the Muscle relaxant Rocuronium
PR_SPV_ _297 Emanating patient data
Clinical User requirements - -
PR_SRV-543 The user shall be able to determine the patients current and future hypnotic and analgesic level related to
the leveled intended by user.
Verification process linked to user requirements via
- Standards
- Provision of clinical evidence that TSR matches the user requirement’s
- Comparison with similar devices
- Usability Evaluation Formative and summative reports
DOORs system is in use for Traceability for of Inputs and outputs
The Validation summary report: 11149414 Rev 00 Validation Summary report VOO 2023-02-24 demonstrated during
the audit.
D&D #13 - Design and development change (GP)
The process flow id defined in SOP IND 4200
The process is implemented as a workflow in Pro-X.
A change request is prepared and evaluated by quality assurance, project manager and the product manager, these
changes could be improvement of changes triggered by post-production feedback.
In the case the change influences materials, and these materials are used for other products, the change needs to be
assessed by other PSB .Product Manager and/or other functions decide on the DCR (accept or decline).
After the design change has been accepted, the design change project will be created. This includes the design change
plan, change project, pre-tailoring investigation (central document about which components are affected, recommended
solution and which design reviews should be met), Object List (components which are going to be change), List of
deliverables (which documents should be change
Example — design change to Rev 3.03
The change for the design was summarized as PKG-2021-002776 _Pre-tailoring investigation 18.02.2021
