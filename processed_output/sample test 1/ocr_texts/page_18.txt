Measurement, Analysis, and Improvement - CAPA and Internal Audit

ID: 31505

For both -CAPA and “documented action’- root cause and risk analysis, actions, corrective actions and effectiveness
checks have to be defined and implemented.

It is differentiated in CAPA procedures between quality problems and nonconforming product. Two different procedures
are in place. The sources and impact of all issues will be analyzed and documented.

DEMF/DCS PQ2510 product CAPA

DEMF PQ3300 system CAPA

Furthermore, the handling of nonconforming product are defined in:

DEMF SC6110 : Behandlung von Abweichungen in der Produktion

DEMF SC6111 : Lenkung von fehlerhaftem Material

These procedures are linked to each other.

For each documented action (issue) and CAPA correction and corrective - (preventive) action) is defined.

USA:

Verify procedures ensure that information related to quality problems or nonconforming product is disseminated to
those directly responsible for assuring the quality of such product or the prevention of problems [21 CFR
820.100(a)(6)].

Confirm procedures provide for the submission of relevant information on identified quality problems, as well as
corrective and preventive actions, for management review [21 CFR 820.100(a)(7)].

The manufacturer ensures that information about quality problems or nonconforming products are properly
disseminated to those directly involved in the maintenance of product quality and to prevent occurrence of such
problems. This is assured via regular Quality Boards meetings in each BU or product family/PQB.

During the audit the auditor focused according to audit plan on system related samples.
The CAPA’s (Systems and product) are analyzed and results provided for MR: see One pager CAPA

Brazil:

Verify that the manufacturer has ensured that information about quality problems or nonconforming products are
properly disseminated to those directly involved in the maintenance of product quality and to prevent occurrence of
such problems [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 7.1.1.6].

The manufacturer ensures that information about quality problems or nonconforming products are properly
disseminated to those directly involved in the maintenance of product quality and to prevent occurrence of such
problems. This is assured via regular Quality Boards meetings in each BU or product family/PQB.

During the audit the auditor focused on system related samples.

MAI 1 - Procedures for measurement, analysis and improvement (GM) => Focus on Product

The process to measure, analysis and improve the QMS is established and documented. The process describes the
evaluation of the data from the product.

Investigations are conducted to identify the cause of the detected and potential nonconformities.

Input from various sources, which may represent a complaint is registered, and investigated. The investigation is
conducted as part of NC, CAPA and supplier quality processes in line with requirements of respective SOPs.

The CAPA criteria are defined (risk negative impact on product safety, caused death or injury, cybersecurity
unacceptable risk, not fulfilled regulatory requirements) when an action should be evaluated. In case no action is
started this will be documented. CAPA can be also started without the intervention of the Quality Board, depending on
the meeting of the criteria for CAPA.

When CAPA are set and implemented, these should be evaluated for effectiveness, including the root cause analysis.
All will be documented in the product CAPA in TrackWise. The roles and responsibilities are defined. The timeline for
processing is defined e.g.: 7 days for initial analysis, 60 days for implementation of CAPA plan. It is possible to
include annexes in the documentation.

If the CAPA has a systematic cause, there is a link to the system CAPA process and the other way around.

The KPls are defined for CAPA process and are monitored in monthly meeting. The last 12-month report was
reviewed states the 78% of CAPAs are completed withing set up due target. 22 CAPA were completed in 2022. In
time completion rate: risk assessment 89%, Investigation 41%, completion 65%The KPIs are splitted in BU and shows
CAPA status: ongoing, completed, overdue or effectiveness check overdue.

(Brazil, US) Data will be analysed in Quality Boards, these will be managed by the product quality manager. This
information includes statistical information or individual cases e.g.: complaints. The decision to start a CAPA will be
taken in the Product quality board and documented. It is taken based on three criteria.

When CAPA actions are marked as completed and will be closed only when the effectiveness check is completed.

Additional country-specific requirements:

Brazil (ANVISA):

The manufacturer ensures that information about quality problems or nonconforming products are properly
disseminated to those directly involved in the maintenance of product quality and to prevent occurrence of such
problems. This is assured via Quality Boards meeting as describe above.

United States (FDA):

The Procedure ensures that information related to quality problems or nonconforming product is disseminated to those
directly responsible for assuring the quality of such product or the prevention of problems — This performed via Quality
board mechanism and statistical approach as discussed above
