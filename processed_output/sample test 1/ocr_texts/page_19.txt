Subsystem Measurement, Analysis, and Improvement - CAPA and Internal Audit

During the audit the auditor focused on product related samples.
MAI 2 - Sources of Quality data (GM) 8.4
Appropriate sources of quality data have been identified for input into the measurement, analysis and improvement
process, including customer complaints, feedback, service records, returned product, internal and external audit
findings, nonconformities from regulatory audits and inspections, and data from the monitoring of products, processes,
nonconforming products, and suppliers.
This have been verified with the last MR where all these data have been verified.(One pager’s based on the above
mentioned topics have been audited)
Data from these sources are accurate and analyzed according to a documented procedure -DEMF PQ8050 : Statistical
Techniques - for the use of valid statistical methods (where appropriate) to identify existing and potential product and
quality management system nonconformities that may require corrective or preventive action.
MAI 2 - Sources of Quality data (HD) 8.4
Input from various sources, which may represent a complaint is registered, and investigated. The investigation is
conducted as part of NC, CAPA and supplier quality processes in line with requirements of respective SOPs. Further
sources such as trends, production quality control data, service records, audit finding etc. are analysed and
evaluated.
Complain trainings, warranty trending, FFR rates and Supplier PPM rate evaluations are performed in quarterly
meetings.
MAIS - Root cause analysis of detected NC’s__ (GM) 8.5.2
Investigations are conducted to identify the underlying cause(s) of detected nonconformities, where possible.
Several cases have been audited as samples to verify, that cause analysis have been cunducted:
#12237 1/#122373/#122374/#1 2237 7/#122378
Investigations are commensurate with the risk of the nonconformity. This is asured by conducting risk analysis for each
issue “documented action” or “CAPA”, system and product related as described under MAI 1
Additional Sample risk analysis audited:#103501
Monitoring and measurement of processes (8.2.5), product (8.2.6)
MAI 3 — Investigation of Nonconformity (HD) 8.5.2
Investigation of Nonconformity & Investigation of Potential Nonconformity
The process is established. Investigations are conducted to identify the (underlying) cause of the detected
nonconformities. Several established methods for root cause analysis are used, such as 5W or Fishbone.
Investigations are proportional to the risk of the nonconformity (risk-based approach), criteria are defined e.g.: Go as
far as possible if following applies:
-Death or injury
-Complain indicate new trend
-Client or authority request deep investigation
-Complain classified as AE
Potential non-conformities are also detected and analysed accordingly.
The root cause is determined for all CAPA.
PR 124066 dd. 03.11.2022- Brazil. The foreign body in expiratory membrane of Babylog VN600 the device was not in
use. Complain investigation report states that this is impurity of manufacturing process. It is in ex breathing membrane
and cannot go to the patient. The risk is known. Action communication with supplier.
PR 1321136 dd. 21.06.2023 USA - FoA (Warranty) anaesthesia circuit flex 6. No patient involvement. Circuit
cracking/tearing impacts the ventilation of patient (reduced breathing). Risk is known and evaluated no new / higher
risk. An DCR (design change request) was started to evaluate if other material could ensure more mechanical
force DCR 2023-004142.
PR 126323 dd. 06.12.2022 Canada- disposable birthing hose. The investigation was performed no new or unknown
risk.
PR 126748 dd. 08 12.2022 Australia ECG Mono Leads 4.1m MP0531. The cable caused pressure injury by the
patient. The new mono lead has higher dimeter as the old version. DCR 2023-001245 it was decided to update the
risk management file including update of IFU (new IFU) as the risk was not identified. The IFU update with proper use
of cables.
MAI 4 - Investigation of potential NC’s (GM) 8.5.3
Potential non-conformities regarding product and product processes are analyzed within FMEA’s.
Sample of FMEA’s have been audited: FMEA PIA-PIA2
Investigations are conducted to identify the (underlying) cause of the detected nonconformities. Several established
methods for root cause analysis are used in general, such as 5W or Fishbone. Investigations are commensurate with
the risk of the nonconformity.
Furthermore, during each MR an evaluation of internal audit results related to QMS processes will be done and
documented to estimate whether any new or higher risk related to main QMS processes can be assumed derived from
current internal audit performance. Evaluation of internal audit results of MR 2023 have been audited.
Corrective action (8.5.2), Preventive action (8.5.3)
