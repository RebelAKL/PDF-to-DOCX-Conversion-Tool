Measurement, Analysis, and Improvement - CAPA and Internal Audit

ID: 31505

MAI 4 - Investigation of potential NC’s (HD) 8.5.3

The investigation of potential non-conformities is documented and performed in the same way as for non-conformities,
as discussed in Task 3.

CAPA process is defined in SOP PQ2510 and contains criteria to raise a CAPA.

The inputs for the product quality boards are prepared by the report owner, based on the criteria defined in the
process. There is an investigation plan in place.

This data includes information from failure rate in production, installation, complaints, failure of parts, among others.
CAPAs are also triggered by non-conformities detected in other processes.

There is the possibility to close a CAPA without actions, the rationale has to be documented.

MAL 5 - Confirm corrections, corrective actions and preventive actions (GM) 8.5.2; 8.5.3

Corrections, corrective actions, and preventive actions for system CAPA are defined and implemented according to the
documented procedure — DEMF PQ3300.

Inputs and outputs are defined. CAPA triggers, criteria and responsibilities are defined. See MAI 1

Systems CAPA triggers are e.g.: management review, processes, procedures, records of services, systematic
problems, etc. The CAPAS are documented in Track Wise. Some events according to the CAPA criteria are
documented as “Documented Action” and not as CAPA. The investigation process for “documented action “ is not
that extensive as by the CAPA. It requires a “documented action response report” after investigation. Each
“documented action” can be escalated to CAPA.

Each case will be evaluated regarding risk within the risk form: PQ3300 — A01 Risk evaluation template. Following
aspects will be evaluated: Environment, Employees, Health of patients or users, integrated Managemensystem
/certification, and product conformity. If there is any risk identified a description and evaluation of the situation have to
be documented. Based on this evaluation the decision for further processing “CAPA” or documented action “ will be
done.

For each CAPA (not for “documented action”) a CAPA plan should be provided and the CAPA plan have to be checked
and approved by CAPA Reviewer. The CAPA reviewer will take the decision whether the planned actions are
appropriate to the risk.

For both CAPA and documented action root cause and risk analysis, actions, corrective actions and effectiveness
checks have to be defined and implemented.

It is differentiated in CAPA procedures between quality problems and nonconforming product. Two different
procedures are in place. The sources and impact of all issues will be analyzed and documented.

MAL 5 - Confirm corrections, corrective actions and preventive actions (HD) 8.5.2; 8.5.3

Correction, Corrective Action, and Preventive Action

Corrections, corrective actions, and preventive actions for product CAPA are defined and implemented according to
the documented procedure DCS PQ2510-013.

Inputs and outputs are defined. CAPA triggers, criteria and responsibilities are defined. The CAPA criteria are defined
(risk negative impact on product safety, caused death or injury, cybersecurity unacceptable risk, not fulfilled regulatory
requirements) when an action should be evaluated

The CAPAS are documented (Track Wise). Some events according to the CAPA criteria are documented as
Documented Action and not as CAPA. The investigation process is not that extensive as by the CAPA. It requires a
Documented Action Response Report after investigation. Each Documented Action can be escalated to CAPA.

The timeline for processing is defined e.g.: 7 days for initial analysis, 60 days for implementation of CAPA plan. It is
possible to include annexes in the documentation.

If the CAPA has a systematic cause, there is a link to the system CAPA process and the other way around.

The KPls are defined for CAPA process and are monitored in monthly meeting. The last 12-month report was
reviewed states the 78% of CAPAs are completed withing set up due target. The KPIs are splitted in BU and shows
CAPA status: ongoing, completed, overdue or effectiveness check overdue.

For reviewed CAPA examples see records

MAI 6 - Assessment of Design Change resulting from Corrective or Preventive Action (HD)

WwWhen the CAPA is outcome in Design change — Change Control process is involved.

The routes for design changes are possible depends on the significant of changes are described in procedure.
Relevant steps are documented. Wen DCR is accepted the — PKG (Package) will be created including the list of
deliverables. Further steps are investigation, plan DC, implement DC, execute DC, transfer and DC closure.

PR 126748 dd. 08 12.2022 Australia ECG Mono Leads 4.1m MP0531. The cable caused pressure injury by the
patient. The new mono lead has higher dimeter as the old version. DCR 2023-001245 it was decided to update the
risk management file including update of IFU (new IFU) as the risk was not identified. The IFU update with proper use
of cables.

DCR 2021-006406 PKG 2020-002624 EHF (DCR flow sensor). The flow sensor produced previously by supplier was
transfer to the DWAG production line in Lubeck. As part of this change also the color of the housing was changed as
well as slight changes in the housing shape.

MAI 7 - Process change -> revalidation (GM) 7.5.6; 8.5.2
When a corrective or preventive action results in a process change, the process change is assessed to determine if
any new risks to the product are introduced.
