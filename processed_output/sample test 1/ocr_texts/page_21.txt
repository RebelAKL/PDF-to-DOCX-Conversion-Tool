DEMF SC6500: Anlage A02 ATLAN Arbeitsplatz SM2 SM1

DEMF SC6500: Anlage A02 Babyleo Arbeitsplatz SM2 SM1,

Canada:

Verify that the manufacturer has a process or procedure for identifying a “significant change” to a class III or IV device.
Verify that information about “significant changes” is submitted in a medical device license amendment application
[CMDR 1, 34].

Requirements implementation Verified and described withis two audited samples:

DEMF SC6500: Anlage A02 zu Dokumentation von Produktionsprozessen, 02, point 4. ,Bewertung der Anderungen*
including question ,Aktuailsierung Process FMEA ,, and ,, Verification needed” and Validierung erforderlich” . Additional
it is assured that if any change in STED of products is needed (change in PQ 2110), that the Design change process is
applicable and respective reports will be done. Assessment of changes are triggered and the following SOP’s and
instructions have to be followed for decision about significant change and related duties:

DWAG PQ2110 : Regulatory Approval to Market Product DWAG PQ2110 - en - 04.00 , Rev. 04.00

A08 DWAG PQ2110 Assessment of changes to medical devices, rev 04.00 — specifics of all MDSAP countries are
inserted (Canada/Brazil/Japan/Australia/USA/Europe) and supported by change overview matrix with further country
specifics of all MDSAP countries helping for the decision whether there is a significant change. If any significant
change is evaluated a regulatory affairs manager will be informed for conduction of all further needed steps related to
different MDSAP areas affected

Australia:

Confirm that the Manufacturer’s procedure for dealing with substantial changes to a critical process (e.g. sterilization,
processing materials of animal origin, processing materials of microbial or recombinant origin, or processes that
incorporate a medicinal substance in a medical device), requires the Manufacturer to notify the Auditing Organization
of their plans before implementing a change to a critical process. The Auditing Organization is to assess the proposed
change before implementation by the Manufacturer, to determine if the requirements of the relevant conformity
assessment procedure will still be met after the change. [TG(MD)R Sch3 P1 1.5(2)].

If the Manufacturer is also a holder of a TGA Conformity Assessment Certificate, then the Manufacturer is also required
to notify the TGA of these changes, prior to implementation.

Japan:

Confirm that when the Registered Manufacturing Site plans to make a significant change to a manufacturing processes
(e.g. sterilization site change, manufacturing site change), the Registered Manufacturing Site notifies the Marketing
Authorization Holder so as the Marketing Authorization Holder can take appropriate regulatory actions [MHLW MO169:
