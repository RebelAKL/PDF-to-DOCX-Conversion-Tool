Product Service

Subsystem Production and Service Controls - #10578 (Service Center) / # 90464 (ATLAN Series B23)
Work environment and contamination control (6.4)
PSC4 Product cleanliness (GM) _7.5.2
Documented requirements for product cleanliness are established.
Following aspects are copnsidered and defined in DEMF SC6330 :
-Requirements for particle in the air (class 9)
-General Cleaning plans exists
-pestcontrol
It exists a “Reinigingsplan” for B23 with concrete advices for the external personnel. The cleaning execution
will be documented from external company in a table. The cleaning results as well as the documentation will be
checked and confirmed regularly by responsible leader of production.
Futhermore it is defined to control particles according to class 9 requirements. There are 35 measure points in
B23 and a limit of 1 Mio parts is defined. The measurement will be evaluated every 3 month.
Brazil:
Confirm that a pest control program has been established and where chemicals are used as part of the pest control
program, the company must ensure that they do not affect product quality [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.1.3.4].
Verify that themanufacturer has established andmaintains housekeeping procedures and schedules for production areas
and warehouses, in conformance with production specifications [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.1.3.1].
Pest control in B 23 will be done on a monthly base from external supplier Bockholdt.
Last report have been audited.
PSC6 work environment conditions; training or supervision of personnel (GM) 6.4
///Revalstr. — “Line 2—ATLAN  "///
It exists a “Reinigingsplan” for B23 with concrete advice for the external personnel. The cleaning will be
documented from external company in a table. The cleaning results as well as the documentation will be
checked and confirmed regularly by responsible leader of production.
Futhermore it is defined to control particles according to class 9. There are 35 measure points and a limit of 1
Mio part is defined. The measurement will be done every 3 month.
Brazil:
Verify that biosafety standards are used, when applicable [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.1.3.6
See description above no further requirements defined and needed
Control of production and service provision (7.5.1)
PSC7/PSC8 validation of processes (GM) 7.5.6
Generally all processes of ATLAN prodcution are listed and are validated at least partly. Revalidation will be
done according to specific triggers which are defined in SOP e.g. move of production or process changes.
The validation of selected ATLAN processes has been done according to IN4300. When steps of validation or
process steps haven't been necessary to evaluate, a justification is given. In general |Q/OQ and PQ will be
part of the validation process or a justfication is given for exclusion of one of these aspects from a dedicated
process step validation.
No molding no welding or gluing process applicable at ATLAN production.
Sample of validation after move of ATLAN production (2020) and Change project (ATLAN 2.0 ) validation have
been audited.
Validation demonstrates the ability of the process(es) to consistently achieve the planned result.
Australia:
Confirm that methods of validation have regard to the generally acknowledged state of the art (e.g. current Medical
Device Standard Orders - MDSO, ISO/IEC Standards, BP, EP, USP etc.) [TG Act s41CB, TG(MD)R Sch 1 P17 2(1)].
Validation of processes are performed according to:
GHTF SG3 N99-10 2004 Quality Management Systems-Process Validation, 02.January 2004
USA:
Process validation is required for sterilization, aseptic processing, injection molding, and welding [21 CFR
820.75; preamble comment 143].
No sterilization, molding no welding or gluing process applicable at ATLAN production.
Brazil:
Verify that analytical methods, supporting auxiliary systems for production and environmental control that can adversely
affect product quality or the quality systemare validated, periodically reviewed and, when necessary, revalidated
according to documented procedures [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.5.2, 5.5.3].
Temeparture/Humidity and pressure measurement equipment will be calibrated acc. to respective SOP
requirements. See also PSC 13/14 with respective samples
PSC10 monitoring and measuring of product capable to product conformity (GM) 8.2.6
The system for monitoring and measuring of product characteristics can demonstrate the conformity of
products to specified requirements. Test requirements for ATLAN series have been defined. Test
specification samples for ATLAN series have been audited.
The product risk is considered in the type and extent of product monitoring activities.
Risk assessment ATLAN product series is performed and will be adjusted with needed input and output as
described under D&D (PMS activities, CAPA handling etc.)
Last version of risk assesment ATLAN 2.0 have been audited.
PSC11 monitoring and measuring of product within specified limits risk conrols GM) 8.2.5
The processes used in production and service are appropriately controlled, monitored, operated within
specified limits and documented in the product realization records. ATLAN Test samples during production
have been audited.
Risk control measures identified by the manufacturer for production processes are implemented,
monitored and evaluated.
The product risk is considered in the type and extent of product monitoring activities.
