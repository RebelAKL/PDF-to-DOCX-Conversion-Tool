Subsystem Design and Development
SOPs for design and development were demonstrated and assessed during the audit — ref to list of documents for
Designee and Development chapter.
Additional country-specific requirements:
Australia / Brazil / Canada / Japan
- the organisation has identified no exclusion from Design control. All product families are controlled by the top-level
design process.
D&D #2 - Selection of a completed design and development project (GP)
1. Smart Pilot View was selected based on the sampling plan to cover the product range of the company, as product with
direct impact to safety and performance which was not yet evaluated during the surveillance cycle. The product was
chosen as linkage to the on-going Technical Documentation review.
2. The product Connected Lung Protective Ventilation Analytics was chosen as verification if this can be a medical
product in MDSAP scope. It was observed, the product is not a Medical Device, and therefore is out of scope for this
audit.
The introduction product performed: Smart Pilot View is monitoring and predication software for an Anesthesia
application. The software displays and logs the dosage of intravenous and volatile drugs administered in human
being. Additionally, it calculates the drug effect based on pharmacokinetic models and the drug interaction as guidance
for treatment. Current release is 3.03
The devices classification is IIb according to MDR and MDD. The Device is currently MDD , and under MDR TD review.

D&D #11 - Clinical evaluation and/or evaluation of medical device safety and performance (GP)
Smart Pilot View

Clinical evaluation and clinical investigation processes are established. CE is performed as a part of design and

validation process and is documented in CER. CERs are organized to be grouped in “CER-families” if only possible.
Aspects for a CER family: Similar or same intended purpose (similar literature search) etc. The process is set up with a
main SOP DCS IN4250-110-en-03.00_Clinical Evaluation is the main SOP for MDR compliance, a separate SOP is
available for the products under MDD IN 4251.
Clinical performance and clinical benefit are mainly processed by the Clinical Affairs Team whereas clinical risks and
clinical safety is assessed in the frame of the RM in close collaboration with the clinical / medical expert, this assessment
is then fed back into the CEP/CER.
Literature searches are conducted for the state of the art and the MDuE, for performance / benefit and safety. Search
criteria are defined in the CEP and are generated according to the PICO approach.
Preclinical data based on applicable standards are considered in CEP and CER.
Review of Postproduction Information Report (RPPIR): this assessment is used for updates from the post-market phase
on a regular basis.
The complete CER is re-assessed when above listed documents are created to confirm or revise the contents.
This approach is described in the main CER SOP.
For the sampled device Smart Pilot View:
Latest clinical evaluation covered by clinical evaluation plan — shown during the audit, Clinical evaluation report was
demonstrated: 11149213_02 11149213 02 Clinical Evaluation Report Released
Confirmation of Applicability (CoA): this assessment is used if new, not clinical information is available it will be integrated
into an already existing CER-family with the next periodic update.
PMCF Process:
DWAG |IN4250 Clinical Evaluation explains the process and documentation for PMCF Report established for that
process. In step 17 od CE Process the decision on PMCF activities is done. There is PMCF Plan Template, PCF
Checklist and
PMCF plan includes need for PMCF, objectives, type of activity, description, rationale for appropriateness, timeline,
summary of activities, evaluation of clinical data relating to equivalent or similar products, risk management report.
In case of sampled product Smart Pilot View, PSUR contains statement that PMCF is fully based on PMS surveillance
there is no need on active PMCF apart from Routine PMS
It was explained that the SSCP process is not applicable as there are no class III devices manufactured.
Post-market phase: update of CERs, the frequency depends on risk class and innovation status. Frequency is 2 to 5
years until end of production plus 7 years, or end of service and 2 more years.
Additional country-specific requirements:
Australia (TGA):
Clinical Evaluation Reports includes the clinical evidence based on PMS history of the device. This can be presented by
Literature search in line with IN4250 - Template - Literature Search
D&D #12 - Software design and development (GP)
The Development of Software follows the V-Model approach.
