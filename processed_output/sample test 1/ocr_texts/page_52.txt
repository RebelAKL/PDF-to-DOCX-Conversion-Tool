ID: 31505

Risk assesment ATLAN product series is performed and will be adjusted with needed input/output as described
under D&D (PMS activities, CAPA handling etc.)

Last version of risk assesment ATLAN 2.0 have been audited.

Records of in production- and final tests have been audited.

PSC15 Validation of software used in production (GM) 7.5.6
In production are parts of SAP in usage. Whole SAP tool with all used modules are validated from SW
validation officers ( see also docu Pavlov).
Main used SAP Modul in productionis: PLESS validation protocol have been audited
Furthermore some teststations with SW are in use. Here the whole test sttion will be validated.
One sample have been audited.

PSC16 product file (GM) 4.2.3; 7.5.9.1
Conduction of product file is defined in:
DEMF SC6200 : Produktherstellung
ATLAN 300/350 configurations are documented in SAP; based on the customer order specification an
individual product test specification is created in SAP which leads to test plans. The individual product file will
be completed during production steps up to the final testing in SAP. Each test step can only be processed
when the step before has been finished and confirmed in product file.
It could be determined within samples that the medical device organization has established and maintained a
file for each type of device that includes or refers to the location of device specifications, production process
specifications, quality assurance procedures, traceability requirements, and packaging, labelling specifications,
and when applicable requirements for installation and servicing.
It could also be confirmed via auditing samples of product files that the medical device organization determined
the extent of traceability based on the risk posed by the device in the event the device does not meet specified
requirements.

USA:
If a control number is required for traceability, confirm that such control number is on or accompanies the device
throughout distribution [21 CFR 820.120(e)].
Every device gets a label with the serial number at the beginning of assembly. Serial No of device is
connected to order No and the DHS in .At the end the final label is put on the device which includes also the
same serial number. This serial number is also used for the packaging label.

Canada:
Verify that the manufacturer maintains objective evidence that devices meet the safety and effectiveness requirements of
the CMDR [CMDR 9(LA)].
Verify that devices sold in Canada have labeling that conforms to Canadian English and French language requirements
and contains the manufacturer’s name and address, device identifier, control number (for Class III and IV devices),
contents of packaging, sterility, expiry, intended use, directions for use and any special storage conditions [CMDR 21-
23).
Verify that the manufacturer maintains distribution records in respect of a device that will permit a complete and rapid
withdrawal of the device from the market [CMDR 52-56].
All devices are designed to meet the safety and effectiveness requirements of the CMDR. The type tests
(testing of IEC 60601-1 family) are done while design and development phase. The technical documentation is
checked while the regular technical file review according to MDR. Additionally, the passed final test (see
respective task documentation: “accaptence”) makes sure that essential safety aspects are verified. All final
labels of the device and packaging contain: manufacturer's name and address, device identifier and any
special storage conditions. The language is English, or symbols are used on the label. User manuals in several
languages (also French) are available and will be distributed together with device that are sold to Canada. The
DHR includes all information about distribution (in case of withdrawal from the market).
Brazil:
Verify that the manufacturer has established and maintains procedures to ensure integrity and to prevent accidental
mixing of labels, instructions, and packaging materials [RDC ANVISA 16/2013: 5.2.2.1].
Confirm that the manufacturer has ensured that labels are designed, printed and, where applicable, applied so that they
remain legible and attached to the product during processing, storage, handling and use [RDC ANVISA 16/2013:
5.2.2.2].
Components (e.g. PCB, Screen) and enclosure have a separate label with their serial number. All these
components are documented in the DHR per each device in the ERP System so that accidental mixing is
prevented according to DCS GM2150-013.Additionally, scan checks of correct IFU's and labels will be
performed. If system gets a wrong scan check the task can’t be closed. At the end the final label is put on the
device. All final labels are designed and printed that way that they withstand storage, handling and use which is
required by IEC 60601-1. The labels are tested according to IEC 60601-1 family.
Australia:
Verify that the design and location of information to be provided with a medical device, including labelling and instructions
for use, comply with Essential Principle 13 and implant cards and leaflets with Essential principle 13A
See Canada/Brazil

PSC17 approve of batch releases GM) 7.5.1; 8.2.6
It could be determined that the medical device organization has established and maintained a record of the
amount manufactured and approved for distribution. The release will be performed and documented for each
medical device (ATLAN series). The record is verified and approved, the device is manufactured according to
the file referenced in Task 16, and the requirements for product release were met and documented.
