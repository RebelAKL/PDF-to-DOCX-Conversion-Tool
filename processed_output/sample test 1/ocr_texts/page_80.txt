Competency / Training records verified in respect to the prodcuation operate in the Final Function ? temperature test
Babylog TN 500 — train records were demonstrated in relation to the operation performed during the audit.
Training for Final release of production records Arbeits Vorganag 1590 was verified in relation of Operator Dirk Schnoor
— who was observed as released DHR at last step of basis Device — demonstrated during the audit
PSC 13 - Control of monitoring and measuring device
It was observed that measurement equipment in production area are identified with individual ID numbers, also the
measurement equipment which used as part of production rigs / stations.
The measurement equipment critical for safety and performance was sampled and verified during the audit:
Calibration certificate.
US 416581 Torque controlled wrench - Calibration certificate by Test valid 28.10.2020
Electrical screwdriver
Additionally, calibration certificates were verified for Temperature measurement station / Functional test
Temperature Measurement Station ID 505278 / 4214. It was confirmed the calibration was performed in time and
includes both multichannel station and related thermocouples.
PSC 14 - Impact analysis of monitoring and measuring device found out of specifications
Impact is investigation in relation of the instrument, which failed calibration - investigation demonstrated: the decision to
write of the instruments, the analysis of the impact was performed in respect of the medical devices,
According to justification, the toque of the wrench, which failed calibration was within the tolerated are - statement:
no additional risk observed, the investigation performed by the device responsible manager.
PSC 16 - Device master file
He DMR is generated according to the DEALL PQ3130_A02_ - Rev 04.02

The review- and approval of DHR ASRM0019 07.11.2022
The release of the Label is documented and approved in DHR
Verification of the Label — according to the to DEMF SC6400_A01-de-00
The labelling is printed directly in the production and verified as part of the final release according to according to the to
DEMF SC6400_A01-de-00

Each device maintains the Serial Number which is used for traceability
PSC 17 - Production record; evidence of compliance of released devices
The DHR is formed at the production of top-level sub-assemblies and is defined as sub-DHR , the linked to the top-level
DHR for Basis device, and subsequently the DHR for the finished configured device via serial numbers of subassemblies
and finished device.
DHR was sampled from the distribution list and demonstrated during the audit for the device TN500 ASRL 0056
The auditor has observed the final approval and review stage from production of Babyleo TN500 Basis device — it was
explained that DHR is regarded as approved if all sub-DHRs are completed without errors, and accepted this is an
automatic step in SAP. The review is confirmed by the electronic signature of the operator
Brazil
Device history record of the product includes date of manufacture; components used; quantity manufactured (usually — 1
pcs as DHR is documented for one device); results of inspections and tests; parameters of special processes; quantity
released for distribution; labeling; identification of the serial number or batch of production; and final release of the
product [
The approval, including date, name, and_ electronic signature of the person responsible, must be documented is
documented.
US
The process is defined in DWAG PQ2140-en-04.00. Labels are printed and issued to production for each individual
device, verification is performed by the Operator in production line.
