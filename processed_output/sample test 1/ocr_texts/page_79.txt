(Vorgang), specifically the test steps shall be documented as Priifanweisung according to DEMF SC6500
Documentation von Produktionsprozessen, the records documented as a part of electronic DHR.

//[Baby Leo Production Building B23 Line 1// [GP]

In the sampled are of production for baby Leo devices, following steps were observed during the audit:
Electrical safety Test

Electrical safety test — finished Basis-device with High Voltage Tester: Id 302303(HiPot) and 3032338 (Leakage
Current)
Safety test Operating instruction W01-0012

Final Function test (basis-device)

Functional test / incl temperature test for TN500 S/N 2M6001-19-ASSK-0088

Temperture Test was observed in prductaion for Device Order 65577324

Average temperature / Maximum teperature test wasobserved and record verified according to Final performnec AVO-
3220 Final / Performance test

Linke to measurement equipment observed for humidty meters ate funstional tes area

1) ID506091 /4214

2) 1ID505128 /4214

Linkage to the temeparture mesuremnt system observed ID 505278 / 4214

Water preapration station for Humidty generator in funtiona testiing: the de-aionising filter with conductivity meter
Water Conductivity meter — identified ID 2800, water prepeartion unut installed 23.01.2016

Operator demosnatrted the Functional /Temperture testing — Marius Wydra

The verfication of skin sensor (externally connected part ) was not observed in final Function prducation — its was
explained this test is perfomed at in-process prducation satation. This was verfied for one finished devce based of DHR:
Work Plan material Base device TN 500 Planer 5006010 Rev5

Vorgang 3190 Arbeitsplatz 4214 /012

Test of the skin temperetaure 39.5

The pre-production of the assemblies and pre-finished devices is built anonymously to the production assembly
warehouse M5 -— and completed on the specific production order for individual customer.

5 Assembly Work Stations observed in final production area —- Software download - - Electrical safety test — Final
performance test (Environment control) -> Local assembly lager (customer neutral devices) - > customizing station —
(customization station by the specific customer order) - > Electrical safety test ( repeated) -> Functional test and
Language seeing for the client - Internal waiting areas - - >

The final production and release is performed in two stages:

- Production of basic device — customer neutral / unconfigured

- Configuration of finished device, including installation of particular SW / Partial retest and release packaging and
dispatch . The packaging B3B — packaging in the separate Building.

After the construction has been finished, the devices go to the hall B3, to be packed and sent to the customer.

There is a working plan, which is distributed according working places, (paperless production) and controlled trough
SAP, which indicates which productions steps have been completed and allow the device to continue the assembly. The
whole order paper and preparation documents are linked to the order. In the case additional information is needed of has
to be provided, the supporting documents are linked to the working place.

The processes used in production are appropriately controlled, monitored, operated within specified limits and
documented in the product realization records. The electronic assembly and test instruction were observed.
He auditor has observed assembly operation — assessment was performed that operation are performed in lined with
defined Work Instructions and defined parameters, following operation selected and observed on production floor
1. Trolley assembly
Installation of Hubsaule LINAK Part Nr 2M60521-08
Production Order records performed in PLESS (Paper les Order system)
Installation of Separation Power supply ZP/N 8421200-09 S/N ASSE-507

Assembly of the trolley — installation of Radiant Heater — checked if toque screwdrivers correctly applied during the
prediction operations;

Drawing 2M60600-09 Radian of Radiant Heater assembly

Verified if the Torques screwdrivers correctly identified and used _- verified actual Toque screwdrivers to the drawing
1) Screwdriver 1.8 NM — screwdriver 1D416048/4217

2) Screwdriver 8NM — ID 415989

The Toque settings were verified against the drawing -— found in line with drawing requirements

W01-006Radiant heater assembly _ work station 4 for Prodcuation Order 6557743 S/N 2 M600-1-19-ASSK-0106

Australia
The production observed in line with required parameters and documented instruction. No devices for Australis were
observed, it was explained the devices are manufactured as country-neutral for subsequent labelling and packaging
