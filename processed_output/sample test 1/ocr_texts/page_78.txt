Subsystem Production and Service Controls - #90464 (RevalstraRe / BabyLeo)
MDR 106091 Babyleo TN500 Document of STED Ver 6 202-11-09
Part No 2M60000 / BabyLeo TN 500
Basic UDI DI 040486751306011VK19Z0008,
Main GTIN (UDI DI) 04048675436607
GTIN is issued by GS1
UDI data Set is documented in Attachment
PSC-2 — Selection of production and service process(es)
Line 1 — Babyleo was sampled in line with overall sampling plan for Drager as new device not audited in respect of
production. The selection was defined in line with Sampling plan
Final production and functional test were selected as process with direct impact to safety and performance.
PSC-5.— Infrastructure
The process for control of the infrastructure is defined in DEMF SC6330 Instandhaltung und Reinigung. The decision on
the specific requirement for maintenance of the equipment is performed, when the new process or equipment is
introduced according to Qualification of Production. The result of initial evaluation of production equipment shall be
documented as DEMF SC6330_A06 Betriebsmittel/- Anlagenbewertung
Based on the areas observed during the audit in production (Building B23), the production areas are well organised and
maintained.
The verification in respect of Water supply preparation system was performed — the statement of the manufacturer , no
maintenance was planned as the quality of water is measured based on the conductivity meter — conductivity of 2 to 30
mkS/cm was demonstrated , with max permissible level 20 mikes.
The manufacturer instruction was demonstrated — no requirements for periodic maintenance wre defined. Accepted
based on observed water conductivity well within defined framework.
ESD measures are applicable across all production area. Those include the conductive flooring, equipotential
connections to all equipment, presents of ESD mats on the work benches (observed during the audit at Babyleo
production) , use of ESD furniture and closing .
The presence of control station for ESD check uniform foot ware was verified by the auditor.
The periodic inspection of ESD measures is performed twice a year — the last inspection report demonstrated, the
reports confirms in-depth testing of the conductivity in production area — including the floor surfaces (conductivity in the
region of 22 — 25 MOhm was achived0 and testing of the furniture and work benches.
Brazil
adequate means for people flow. Was assured in production areas — verified by visual inspection during the audit at
Building B23
PSC-6. — Work environment
In the audited production area Baby Leo, building 23, no special environmental requirements applied, with exception of
Functional test Lab.
In the Functional test area, the control of temperature is implemented. Within the span of 20...25C. The temperature is
logged during the active test performance, the calibration of the temperature measurement system was verified during
the audit.
Note: the organisation has adopted the cleanroom process , this was verified as part of the audit in another production
area
Brazil
Biosafety standards were not applicable in the sample dare of production — no use of chemical was observed.
The water used in functional testing is soft water )de-ionized) — not relevant for biosafety.
PSC 7 - Identification of processes subject to validation
The Identification of the process subject for validation is performed as a part of Transfer to production.
The organisation has not identified any production processes subject to validation with Babyleo TN500. This was
challenges by the auditor during the observation on the production floor — nevertheless, no process subject to validation
were observed in Production area for Baby Leo. The processes is 100%, final assembly does not include gluing, welding
or soldering.
Brazil
NA- the processes subject to validation were identified for Babyleo TN500
US
NA — in the sampled and audited production are no sterilization, aseptic processing, injection molding, and welding were
observed
PSC 10 - Monitoring and measurement of product conformity
Product conformity is verified during the performance of in-production and final tests, with test procedures documented
and available electronically as part of DMR and were demonstrated during the audit as so called Production steps
